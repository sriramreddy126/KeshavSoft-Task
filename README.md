# KeshavSoft-Task
The goal of this task is to enable the intern to explore Bootstrap 5's oAicial examples and  components, understand their structure, and then design their own clean, modern HTML pages  using a combination of those components. The focus is not just on replication but on visual  appeal, component synergy, and layout composition.
